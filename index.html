    <p>At a press conference held at T-Mobile Arena on Friday, Velasquez joined fellow former UFC heavyweight champion and now WWE champ Brock Lesnar, WWE superstar Braun Strowman, and heavyweight boxing champion Tyson Fury to officially announce the headlining matches for the WWE “Crown Jewel.” </p>

    <p>Having competed in one of the most prolific heavyweight title fights in UFC history, Velasquez and Lesnar will face off again – this time in a pro wrestling match on Oct. 31 at King Fahd International Stadium in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

In a media scrum conducted after the press conference, Velasquez spoke about what the transition from MMA to professional wrestling has been like as he performed in one of Mexico’s premiere promotions these past few months.

According to Velasquez, his journey started in February when he attended the WWE’s “Elimination Chamber” event along with teammate and then-UFC champ Daniel Cormier. “(We) saw the show,” Velasquez said. “I put out some stuff on social media just because it brought back those memories of me being a kid, watching it, having a great time. Just the whole experience.

“I had my people get in contact with the WWE so we could go to the training center and just mess around and see if I could even do this. I was there for a week, (and) I loved it. From then on, I’ve just been in talks with the WWE. We’ve had meetings here and there, and finally I’m here.”</p>
